# Spinning Cell !

> Spinning Cell is a game that i made with a couple of friends for a
> school internal competition back in september of 2021.

The game is about a cell and a virus, in which the objective for the player is to collect as many oxygen orbs that are scattered throughout the level. It combines educational aspect and rage inducing aspect with it's clunky ***spinny*** control. Definitely not a bug : )

It was made in C# and the unity game engine.
